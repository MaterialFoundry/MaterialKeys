The Soundscape function allows you to control the [Soundscape](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/soundscape) module. You can, for example, change the volume of the different channels, mute or solo them, and play sounds from the soundboard.<br>
You enter the Soundscape function by pressing the 8th function button from the top.

There are 4 different pages, which can be accessed using the top-left control keys, from left to right:

* Channel Volume
* Channel Configuration
* Master Volume
* Soundboard

The top-right button can be used to start and stop the soundscape, and the color changes accordingly from red (soundscape not playing) to green (soundscape playing).

### Channel Volume
The volume of each channel is represented by the columns on the Launchpad. The amount of Launchpad keys that are lit indicate the volume, and pressing one of the keys changes the volume in Soundscape.

### Channel Configuration
Each channel is represented by a column on the Launchpad. The 4 buttons do the following, from top to bottom:

* Red: Mute channel
* Yellow: Solo channel
* Blue: Link channel
* Green: Channel is playing

If one of those applies to the channel, the corresponding key lights up bright, otherwise it is dim.<br>
Pressing one of these keys applies the corresponding setting in Soundscape.

### Master Volume
The left-most column of keys represents the Soundscape master volume. Pressing one of the keys changes the volume accordingly.

### Soundboard
The Main Keys section of the Launchpad is divided into 3 parts:

* Top-left 15 keys: These represent the 15 soundboard sounds of Soundscape. Green means there is a sound configured, red means there is no sound configured.
* Top-right key: Pressing this stops all currently playing soundboard sounds.
* Bottom row: These represent the soundboard volume. Pressing one of the keys changes the volume accordingly.
