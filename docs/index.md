## Introduction
Material Keys is a [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module that allows you to control various features of Foundry using a [supported](supportedDevices.md) Novation Launchpad device or through the built-in [emulator](emulator.md). 

Material Keys supports the following functions:

* [Soundboard](./functions/soundboard.md): Play one-off sounds or sound effects
* [Playlist Control](./functions/playlist.md): Play tracks from Foundry playlists
* [Playlist Volume Control](./functions/playlistVolume.md): Control the volume of Foundry playlists
* [Visual Fx](./functions/visualFx.md): Control certain visual effects
* [Combat Tracker](./functions/combatTracker.md): Display and control the combat tracker
* [Token Health](./functions/tokenHealth.md): Display the token health of in-combat tokens
* [Macroboard](./functions/macroboard.md): Execute macros
* [Soundscape](./functions/soundscape.md): Control the [Soundscape](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/soundscape) module

## Abandonment
Abandoned modules are a (potential) problem for Foundry, because users and/or other modules might rely on abandoned modules, which might break in future Foundry updates.<br>
I consider this module abandoned if all of the below cases apply:

* This module/github page has not received any updates in at least 3 months
* I have not posted anything on "the Foundry" and "the League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" Discord servers in at least 3 months
* I have not responded to emails or PMs on Discord in at least 1 month
* I have not announced a temporary break from development, unless the announced end date of this break has been passed by at least 3 months

If the above cases apply (as judged by the "League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" admins), I give permission to the "League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" admins to assign one or more developers to take over this module, including requesting the Foundry team to reassign the module to the new developer(s).<br>
I require the "League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" admins to send me an email 2 weeks before the reassignment takes place, to give me one last chance to prevent the reassignment.<br>
I require to be credited for my work in all future releases.
